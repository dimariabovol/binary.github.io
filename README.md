# art-studio Binary

I made this landing page for my portfolio.

I found Binary psd layout, when I was learning the [BEM-methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/), and I use this methodology in my project.

I learned to do animation by dint of plugin [wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/) and library [Animate.css](https://animate.style/), and tested it in binary site.
