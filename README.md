# Art-studio "Binary"

I made this [Binary landing page](https://dimariabovol.github.io/binary.github.io/) for my portfolio.

This is first project in which I started to use Git version control system.

I found Binary psd layout, when I was learning the [BEM-methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/), and I use this methodology in my project.

I learned to do animation by dint of plugin [wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/) and library [Animate.css](https://animate.style/), and tested it in binary site.
